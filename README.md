# Food Delivery Management System

This repository is designed for setting up a Food Delivery Management System using BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), machine learning, Flask, and basic frontend integration. Below is a step-by-step guide to the project structure.

### 1. Environment Setup <a name="setup"></a>

To start working with Google Cloud services, you need to authenticate using your service account and set up the necessary clients for Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and BigQuery.

Steps to authenticate and set up:
- Use the `google-auth` library to authenticate using a service account key JSON file.
- Initialize the Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery clients using the credentials.
- Install the required libraries like `google-cloud-storage`, `google-cloud-bigquery`, `pandas`, `flask`, etc.

### 2. Loading Data into BigQuery <a name="bigquery"></a>

The synthetic data generated for `Restaurants`, `Customers`, and `Orders` should be loaded into BigQuery for data analysis.

Steps:
- Prepare and store data in CSV format.
- Upload the CSV files to BigQuery using the `google-cloud-bigquery` client.
- Create tables in BigQuery with the appropriate schema for the three datasets.
- Use Python to automate the table creation and data upload processes.

### 3. Machine Learning - Linear Regression <a name="ml"></a>

In this step, we use linear regression to predict the number of orders based on historical data. We use `scikit-learn` to build the regression model.

Steps:
- Extract data from BigQuery (orders data).
- Prepare the data by selecting the relevant features for prediction.
- Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- Fit the linear regression model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model and make predictions on the test data.

### 4. Building REST API with Flask <a name="flask"></a>

We use Flask to expose a REST API that can provide various data summaries, such as the order status summary or order predictions.

Steps:
- Set up a Flask application.
- Create endpoints to expose order summaries (e.g., completed, pending, canceled) and other relevant data.
- Use `jsonify` to return data in JSON format from the API.

### 5. Creating Frontend <a name="frontend"></a>

We use Flask templates or a simple HTML page to display the results of our REST API calls.

Steps:
- Use Flask's `render_template` to render an HTML template.
- Fetch data from the Flask API and display it on the webpage.
- Create a user-friendly UI to display information like order summaries and predictions.

### 6. Visualization <a name="visualization"></a>

Finally, we use Python libraries like `matplotlib` to visualize the results, such as plotting the linear regression line.

Steps:
- Use `matplotlib` to plot graphs like the linear regression line.
- Visualize order amounts over time and compare different restaurants.
- Display the results in a clean and professional format.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a complete guide for setting up and running a Food Delivery Management System with BigQuery, GCS, machine learning, and Flask. The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world system that predicts the number of orders based on historical data and provides relevant information through a REST API and a frontend interface.
